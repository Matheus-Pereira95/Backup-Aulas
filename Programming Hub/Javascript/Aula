Words are called strings 

Boolean represents either true or false 
    Don't need to use "" to declare the boolean value
        ex: var JS_Rocks = true (correct)
            var JS_rocks = "true" (incorrect)

The syntax for incrementation is the name of the variable and "++" followed by a semi-colon (;)
Ex:     var pizza = 1;
        pizza++;

If we want to decrease the value by one we do the opposite
ex:     var pizza = 2;
        pizza--;

In programming, conditional statements are used to perform different tasks based on different conditions
